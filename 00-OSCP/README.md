# OSCP

## Offensive Security Certified Professional

What is an Offensive Security Certified Professional?
The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is the companion certification for our Penetration Testing with Kali Linux training course and is the world’s first completely hands-on offensive information security certification. The OSCP challenges the students to prove they have a clear and practical understanding of the penetration testing process and life-cycle through an arduous twenty-four (24) hour certification exam.

An OSCP has demonstrated their ability to be presented with an unknown network, enumerate the targets within their scope, exploit them, and clearly document their results in a penetration test report.

Dear Applicant,

Thank you for your interest in Penetration Testing with Kali Linux. Please read this entire email carefully as it contains very important information.

Course Prerequisites

To be successful, you must have basic Linux skills - meaning you need to be able to navigate through the Linux filesystem, run simple commands, edit files, and be comfortable at the command line in general. We also recommend being familiar with Bash scripting with basic Perl, Python, or Ruby skills being considered a plus. A solid understanding of TCP/IP including addressing, routing, and subnetting basics are required as well.

Course Information

The Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK) online course is comprised of downloadable videos totaling over eight hours in length and an approximately 350 page PDF lab guide. If you haven't already done so, you can view the course syllabus and objectives at the following link:

Penetration Testing with Kali Linux Syllabus [1]

In addition to these study materials, you will receive access to our online labs where you can practice various attack techniques safely and legally. You can purchase VPN lab access for 30, 60, or 90 days in duration. The lab time begins when you receive your course materials as the content is intended to be practiced as you progress through the course. Based on previous student experiences, we recommend you begin with the 60 day option. Please note that once purchased, lab time is non-refundable.

    The cost for this course with 30 days of labs is: 800$ USD
    The cost for this course with 60 days of labs is: 1000$ USD
    The cost for this course with 90 days of labs is: 1150$ USD

    The certification exam is included in the fees above.


We only accept payment via major credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets.

The time required to complete the course exercises depends on your technical background however, the average reported time by our students is a minimum of 100 hours. Note that this estimate only reflects the time to complete the course exercises and does not include the time needed to attack the various lab systems, which can vary from weeks to months depending on background, aptitude, and available time. Generally we find that 60 days of lab time is suitable for the average student.

You will be able to watch the videos and read the lab guide offline, however the VPN labs require a solid Internet connection - high speed ADSL or cable connection (512/256 minimum). Our labs contain various configurations of Windows and Linux machines with specialized software packages and pentesting applications.

Online Lab Access

Our online VPN lab environment is a critical component of the course and you are provided access along with your course materials on your start date. You may not receive your course materials prior to your lab access as you are expected to work through the course exercises in the lab environment.

Lab access is provided as a consecutive block of time and is non-refundable. You may only pause your lab account under exceptional circumstances and only with valid, written justification. When lab time is paused, resources are still allocated in our lab which remain idle that prevent other students from being able to occupy your position in the labs.

Support Terms

Please note that Penetration Testing with Kali Linux is a self-paced and self-directed course that does not have any official support. In order to be successful, a great deal of independent study and research beyond the presented materials is required. You are expected to conduct extra research in order to compromise various hosts or complete the course exercises.

Our student administrators are available primarily to assist with technical issues related to the online labs but can also provide occasional hints or guidance after a student has demonstrated that they have already put in substantial effort before asking for assistance. We do however have active student forums where help might be found if needed. To get a better understanding of the effort and level of work required in the course, we recommend you refer to our Course Reviews [2] page where you will find numerous unsolicited reviews written by our alumni.

The typical administrative hours for the orders department are 1400 – 2200 GMT and our student administrators are typically online from 0800 – 0300 GMT.

Certification Information

The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) [3] certification challenge is an online exam. You will connect to our exam VPN lab remotely and have 23 hours and 45 minutes to complete the challenge and an additional 24 hours to submit your documentation by email. In addition to meeting the certification exam objectives, you must submit an exam penetration test report in order to be awarded your OSCP designation.

You must schedule the challenge within 90 days of the expiration of your lab time.

Penetration Testing with Kali Linux may qualify you for 40 ISC2 CPE Credits. This applies to students who submit their exercises and documentation at the end of the course or pass the certification challenge. CISSPs can register the Offensive Security training at the ISC2 website. Please note that we cannot register the CPEs on your behalf.
